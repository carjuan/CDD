# Python client to generate images

I wanted to explore `configuration driven development` and build a simple `Python` client.
This type of development is very convenient from a development perspective because it allows you to keep the code clean and simple. The configuration file is the only place where you need to make changes.

This app is using DALLE model to generate images. For more info on DALLE, please visit [OpenAI docs here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create).

## Basic improvements

Extending the app with more settings and serializing images and configuration files for easy transfer storage, and python objects manipulation. A good `Python` library to use would be [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
